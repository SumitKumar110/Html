        <p><strong>I'm a 3rd year computer science student. I'm currently a studying in Indore Institute of Science and Technology. I aspire to be a software developer.

        I am an avid chess player. Chess is not just a game for me; it's a mental exercise that enhances my strategic thinking and problem-solving skills.

        When I'm not strategizing my next chess move, you can find me engrossed in a book. Reading provides me with a gateway to diverse worlds and perspectives, fueling my curiosity and broadening my horizons.
            
        Cricket is another passion of mine. Whether playing on the field or analyzing matches, the sport teaches me the importance of teamwork, perseverance, and handling pressureâ€”skills that are equally crucial in both my academic and personal life.
            
        I'm also intrigued by politics. I keep myself updated with the latest developments and enjoy discussions that explore the impact of political decisions on society. This interest has honed my critical thinking and analytical skills, which are essential in my field of study.
